This code defines several classes that represent events that can be triggered in a web application:

1. `BaseModel`: This is the base class for all event models. It provides basic functionality such as serialization and 
deserialization of event objects.
2. `PageEvent`, `GoToEvent`, `BackEvent`, and `AuthEvent`: These classes represent different types of events that can be 
triggered in a web application. Each class defines a set of attributes that are specific to its type. For example, the 
`PageEvent` class has attributes for the name of the page, the push path, context, clear flag, and next event. The 
`GoToEvent` class has attributes for the URL, query, target, and type. The `BackEvent` class only has a type attribute. The 
`AuthEvent` class has attributes for the token, URL, and type.
3. `AnyEvent`: This is an annotated union type that represents any of the above event classes. It is used to define a 
variable or argument that can accept any of the event types.

The code also defines several type aliases:

* `ContextType`: This is a type alias for a dictionary with string keys and values that are either strings or integers. It is
used to represent the context data for an event.
* `Union[str, None]`: This is a union type that represents a string or None. It is used to represent the URL attribute in the
`GoToEvent` class.
* `Union[Dict[str, Union[str, float, None]], None]`: This is a union type that represents a dictionary with string keys and 
values that are either strings, floats, or None. It is used to represent the query attribute in the `GoToEvent` class.
* `Literal['page']`: This is a literal type that represents the string value "page". It is used to represent the type of an 
event.
* `AnyEvent`: This is an annotated union type that represents any of the above event classes. It is used to define a variable
or argument that can accept any of the event types.
